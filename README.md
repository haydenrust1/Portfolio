# Hayden's Portfolio

With the use of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I have crafted three different HTML documents that make up my Portfolio! The three HTML documents are: an about me page (home), a contact page, and a project page. In order to be a competitve applicant for jobs, I wanted to create an online portfolio that displays who I am and how I work. Through this process, I was able to discover how to utilize and manipulate different bootstrap components to create a clean and asthetic portfolio.
